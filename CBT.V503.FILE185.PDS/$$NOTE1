Please note that when module IKJTABLS resides in an APF authorized
STEPLIB DD in your TSO LOGON PROC, IT COMPLETELY OVERRIDES the tables
in IKJTSOxx in PARMLIB.  Therefore, in order that you should not lose
any authorizations of programs, please look in your own IKJTSOxx
PARMLIB member which is active, and copy all entries which we have
not copied.  Perhaps you have more authorized vendor programs
installed, than we have.

AGAIN, NOTE:  COPY OR ZAP IN ALL PROGRAM NAMES (INTO THE APPROPRIATE
       TABLES) WHICH YOU HAVE IN YOUR IKJTSOxx, AND WHICH WE DON'T
       HAVE IN OUR SAMPLE TABLES .......
