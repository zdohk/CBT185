*  Documentation:   This program is meant to be run as a TSO          *
*                   command, APF authorized, except for the display   *
*                   functions.                                        *

*    Description:   Display an Auth Table entry from the TSO/E "auth" *
*                   program list tables in storage.  Or display the   *
*                   entire table.  Or replace one entry with a new    *
*                   program name.  If you are invoking a display      *
*                   function, then the entire table is shown, unless  *
*                   you enter a number, and then, only that slot is   *
*                   shown.  Only tables manufactured from PARMLIB     *
*                   entries are displayed or changed, not the ones    *
*                   created from IKJTABLS in LPALIB, or from the      *
*                   IKJTABLS load module that was present in an       *
*                   APF-authorized STEPLIB.                           *
*                                                                     *
*       Function:   To substitute one new program name in the global  *
*                   incore TSO auth tables, IKJEFTE2, IKJEFTE8, or    *
*                   IKJEFTAP, IKJEFTNS, or even to the PLATCMD or     *
*                   PLATPGM lists, if they exist.  This is done to    *
*                   any numbered entry of each table.  Or else merely *
*                   display the contents of the entire table, or the  *
*                   contents of any particular numbered entry.        *
*                                                                     *
*                   Also, a blanking function can be performed on     *
*                   the last entry of any table, which is usually     *
*                   blank anyway.  No blanking can be performed on    *
*                   a slot in the middle of a table, because that     *
*                   will invalidate all the table entries after the   *
*                   blanked slot, and it is too dangerous to do,      *
*                   when done irresponsibly.                          *
*                                                                     *
*         Syntax:   ASUB TTA nnn pgmname                              *
*                                                                     *
*                   Where TT is a table code, and A is an action      *
*                   code.                                             *
*                                                                     *
*                   The table code is a nickname for any of the       *
*                   TSO/E auth tables which are incore.  They are:    *

*                   E8 - IKJEFTE8 = AUTHPGM                           *
*                   AP - IKJEFTAP = AUTHTSF                           *
*                   NS - IKJEFTNS = NOTBKGND                          *
*                   PC - FCVE     = PLATCMD                           *
*                   PP - PPVE     = PLATPGM                           *
*                                                                     *
*                   If the action code is B (blank the last           *
*                   entry), then no program name is required.         *
*                                                                     *
*                   If the action code is D (display the last         *
*                   entry), then no program name is required.         *
*                   The default action is to display the entire       *
*                   table, unless a number is entered.  If a          *
*                   number is present, then only that entry           *
*                   number is displayed.  If the number is larger     *
*                   than the number of entries in that particular     *
*                   table, then an informative error message is       *
*                   issued, and the program ends with code = 4.       *
*                                                                     *
*                   If the action code is R (replace the program      *
*                   name) then a number (the table entry number)      *
*                   and a program name are required.  If you want     *
*                   to blank the last slot, instead of putting a      *
*                   program name into it, then use action code B.     *
*                                                                     *
*                   If the PLATCMD or PLATPGM keywords (and at least  *
*                   one name) were not coded in the active IKJTSOxx   *
*                   PARMLIB entry, then there is no control block of  *
*                   names to be pointed to, and therefore no addition *
*                   of names can be made.  The condition is reported. *
*                                                                     *
*             Note:  If an E2, E8, AP, or NS table which is being     *
*                    used by the system, did not come from the        *
*                    IKJTSOxx PARMLIB entry, but it came from the     *
*                    default IKJTABLS entry in LPALIB, then an        *
*                    appropriate error message is displayed, and      *
*                    no action is performed on that table.            *
*                                                                     *
*       Suggestion:  If you want to "nullify" any entry in one of     *
*                    the tables, replace it with a question mark '?'  *
*                    by entering ASUB xxR nn ? .                      *
*                                                                     *
*                    This will replace the program name entry with    *
*                    a question mark (not an executable program)      *
*                    but it will not nullify the subsequent table     *
*                    entries.                                         *
*                                                                     *
