Output of command:  TSUB E2S

     This command throws a bit in the LWA that says that the
     IKJEFTE2 table came from a STEPLIB, and not from an IKJTSOxx
     PARMLIB member.  This has the effect that when someone issues
     a command PARMLIB UPDATE(xx) or SET IKJTSO=xx later, then
     your IKJEFTE2 table which is now marked that it came from
     STEPLIB, will not be overlaid from the "common storage" copy
     of the table.
