        Perspective in Auth Tables for TSO - ASUB or TSUB
        ----------- -- ---- ------ --- ---   ------------

When to use the ASUB program, and when to use the TSUB program.

ASUB displays/changes the PARMLIB-defined tables in common storage.

TSUB displays/changes each TSO Userid's tables in the userid's private
  storage.  Each TSO session actually uses its own private tables, so
  to affect your own session only, use TSUB.

1.  The IKJTSOxx PARMLIB member will manufacture auth tables in common
    storage.  This is done either at IPL time, or via a PARMLIB
    UPDATE(xx) TSO command, or via a SET IKJTSO=xx operator command.
    These tables are:  AUTHCMD (IKJEFTE2), AUTHPGM (IKJEFTE8), AUTHTSF
    (IKJEFTAP), NOTBKGND (IKJEFTNS), and optionally, PLATCMD and
    PLATPGM.  The ASUB command is available to display or change
    entries in any of these tables.  These tables can be changed after
    IPL, using a PARMLIB UPDATE(xx) TSO command, or a SET IKJTSO=xx
    operator command.  These tables are used GLOBALLY across the
    entire LPAR, to manufacture the LOCAL TSO auth tables for each
    userid at LOGON time.  Use the APF-authorized ASUB command to
    display or change these tables or entries in them.

2.  At LOGON time, each TSO userid will have its own auth tables (only
    the first four - AUTHCMD, AUTHPGM, AUTHTSF, NOTBKGND) created in
    Key 0, Subpool 252 storage IN ITS OWN ADDRESS SPACE.  The
    individual TSO user's tables are created at LOGON time either from
    the PARMLIB tables in common storage, or else from a load module
    IKJTABLS containing the proper CSECTs (IKJEFTE2, IKJEFTE8,
    IKJEFTAP, IKJEFTNS) if IKJTABLS is running from an APF-authorized
    STEPLIB defined to that TSO user's LOGON PROC.  These are the
    Local Auth Tables that the TSO session actually uses.  Use the
    TSUB (APF-authorized) TSO command to display or change entries in
    these tables.  The scope of the TSUB command is only for tables in
    the issuing TSO user's session.

3.  If you want to REBUILD the local TSO userid's auth tables at any
    time, then go to CBT File 797 and use either the LLWA or LWATMGR
    authorized TSO commands, optionally together with the LWATEDIT
    ISPF interface for the LWATMGR command.  Since LLWA and LWATMGR
    are authorized commands, they have to be in the AUTHCMD (E2)
    table.  To use LWATEDIT to rebuild auth tables, LWATMGR has to
    additionally be in the AUTHTSF (AP) table.

4.  You can bootstrap all of these commands into your auth tables by
    minimally just authorizing the TSUB command.  Since TSUB can be
    used to change all of your session's auth table entries, once you
    have TSUB, you can then use it to authorize everything else.
    Also, please use the STEPLIB command (CBT File 452 and load module
    in this file) to dynamically STEPLIB any APF-authorized load
    library into your TSO session, that you might have available to
    use for yourself in your installation.  This will get you access
    to load modules for the commands you need.  The STEPLIB command
    also has to be in the AUTHCMD (E2) table, but TSUB can be used
    to put it there initially.
