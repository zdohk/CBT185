CAUTION CAUTION CAUTION  -  when using the ASUB or LSLT program
                            to fill in the last slot of one of the
                            "common storage" TSO AUTH tables.

TSUB is SAFER than ASUB to use for FILLING IN THE LAST SLOT of a table.
-----------------------                           ---------

 When in doubt, use TSUB instead of ASUB.  There is no potential
 using TSUB, to ruin subsequent LOGONs of TSO users.  Sometimes
 filling in the last blank entry of a "common storage" table with
 the ASUB or LSLT programs, will ruin subsequent LOGONS of TSO
 users.  (This has to be tested in each case.  It depends on WHAT
 IS IN THE STORAGE THAT IS JUST AFTER the given TSO auth table.)

Explanation:    (see bottom for a SOLUTION)

 It all depends what is after the table, in storage.

 A blank entry, at the end of any TSO Auth Table, will ALWAYS delimit
 the table.  Auth tables which have LENGTHS associated with them, are
 sometimes delimited by the lengths, but according to a few of the
 programs which read these tables, the table is ONLY DELIMITED BY A
 BLANK ENTRY AT THE END.  Therefore, the program reading the table
 might run into the data past the end of the table, if there is no
 blank entry at the end.

 I have noticed that, depending on what follows the table in storage,
 if the last blank entry of a table has been filled by ASUB or LSLT,
 then SUBSEQUENT TSO LOGONS MAY ABEND in allocation of the DD names
 that the session will require.  Therefore, don't use ASUB or LSLT to
 fill in the last blank entry in a table, unless it is absolutely
 necessary for getting the job done.  Use the LOOK program from CBT
 File 264, to see what is in storage just after the table.  If LOOK
 produces an ABEND on your system, use the UKEYCSA program to allow
 LOOK to work.

SOLUTION :  -------

 In a pinch, if this problem occurs, the solution is to run a
 PARMLIB UPDATE(xx) to replace the public tables, or a SET IKJTSO=xx
 operator command to accomplish the same thing.  These commands
 ALWAYS produce new tables having a blank entry at the end.
